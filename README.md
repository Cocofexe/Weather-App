This is my personal Weather-App, is a minimalist app in this app you can search your city's weather when you find your city this appears on a card on your screen.

#### If you ask how its works?

Here is your answer, in this application you have a Navigation Bar inside this you can find one Search Bar when you write some inside this bar the state of the bar change and its do a FETCH call to the API this answer back with an object in this object are multiple information of the city this information is filtered and accommodated to build the card that following you can see on your screen.

##### In this project I use

- React to do components
- JavaScript to do the logic
- FETCH to do the call to the API.

You need to clone this repository, enter inside the directory and start one console put
`npm install`
and the finishing step when the npm install finish, put on the console 
`npm start`
and wait for the google open and you can try this project.
